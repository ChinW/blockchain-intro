# 2. Consensus

In short, consensus mechanisms are **protocols** that make sure all nodes are synchronised with each other and agree on which transactions are legitimate and are added to the blockchain.

Common consensus algorithms:

## Proof Of Work (POW)

<div class="chain">
    <span>Bitcoin</span>
    <span>Ehterum</span>
</div>

In short: work harder, payment higher

Pros:
- Straight forward;
- No extra meta data needed when syncing up transactions; 
- Huge cost for destroy

Cons: 
- Waste energy
- Slow confirmation (~10mins per block now)
- Needs multiple confirmation, raise branch easily

---

## Proof Of Stake (POS)

<div class="chain">
    <span>Binance</span>
    <span>Stellar</span>
</div>

In short: hold more, get more

Pros:
- Shorten consensus time
- Less "mining" energy needed as the probability is higher for big holders

Cons:

Still need "mining", not really resolve the business pain point; All the consensus confimrations are acutally a kind of expression of prosibility

## Delegated Proof Of Stake (DPOS)

<div class="chain">
    <span>EOS</span>
    <span>WAX</span>
</div>

Same as POS, but it does election first, only leaders (total size: 100) can produce blocks

Pros:
- Energy efficiency
- Faster processing of transactions than PoW and PoS
- Second level verfication

Cons:
- Still needs token to incentize
- Easier to organize an attack
- Without a large number of engaged users, the system will not function as intended

## Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)

<div class="chain">
    <span>Hyperledger Fabric</span>
    <span>Zilliqa</span>
</div>

Pros: 
- High throughput
- Scalable
- Fast

Cons: 
- Requires trust
- somewhat centralized

## Ethereum SDLC

- Download Ethereum Studio
- Build dApp:
    - Smart contract: Solidty/Vyper to develop 
    - Frontend: Web3.js to connect node
- Test:
Use Truffle/Embark/Waffle/etc to complie, link, deployment, test
- Browsers:
    - Blockscout
    - Etherchain
    - Etherscan
- Client Apps:
    - MetaMask (Chrome extension)
    - Parity (Popular)
    - Mist (Official)

---
## Hyperledger Fabric

- POC: use Hyperldger Composer, 30 mins to go
- Build Network: Docker to download below images
    - CA
    - Orderer
    - Peer
    - CouchDB (optional)
- Build App:
Use Golang or NodeJS write "chaincode" (i.e. smart contract), and deploy it to peer nodes
- Test it in test network
- Deploy it to production network
